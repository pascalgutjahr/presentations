Incoming muons are reconstructed by large scale neutrino telescopes or by muon tomography. Since muons 
are able to travel many kilometers through media, they do up to thousands of interactions with a small deflection in each interaction. To estimate the total deflection of all interactions before the detector entry, the tool PROPOSAL is used to simulate the muon deflections for different energies. Thereby, a systematic uncertainty on the angular muon reconstruction can be estimated. Two comparisons with MUSIC and Geant4 and two data-MC agreements are performed and all are in good agreement. The muon deflection increases as the energy decreases and the muon deflection becomes relevant for current experiments for energies less than TeV.
