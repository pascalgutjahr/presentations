Title:
An analysis concept to measure atmospheric prompt muons with IceCube

Abstract:
When cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere, extensive air showers are initiated. The secondary particles produced are divided into 
two components: long-lived, light mesons such as pions and kaons referred to as conventional and short-lived, heavy charmed and 
unflavored mesons referred to as prompt. Both components decay further into muons and neutrinos, 
which are detected with cherenkov and neutrino telescopes. In several 
air shower experiments, muons have been detected more frequently than expected based on simulation. 
To solve this problem, the ratio of the produced pions and kaons 
can be adopted. This ratio can be analyzed by measuring the atmospheric muon and neutrino flux, as muon production is dominated by
pions and neutrino production is dominated by kaons. Additionally, hadron production at energies of PeV and above has 
large systematic uncertainties due to missing data, as the hadronic interaction models are extrapolated.

In this talk, a concept to measure the atmospheric muon flux at high energies using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is presented. The 
main objective is to measure the normalization of the prompt component to constrain the uncertainties in the hadronic interaction models.
