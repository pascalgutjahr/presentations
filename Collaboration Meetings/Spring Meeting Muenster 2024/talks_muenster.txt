1. High level 
- Introduction/Motivation (Muon-Puzzle, hadronic interaction models, neutrinos + muons) [1-2]
- Goal: 1. muon spectrum (unfolding without prior), 2. normalization prompt component 
    (forward fit for specific model) [1]
- Overview (schematic: Simulation - Selection - Reconstruction - forward fit/ unfolding) [1]
- Forward fit: bias plot, prompt scaling plot (slide 55 rights), test statistics plot (toy study, maybe 
    we switch to NNMFit) [2]
- Unfolding: explain unfolding, unfold event rate, explain effective area, unfold muon flux? [3-4]
- Summary (new simulation, systematics, WG request) [1]



2. Details
- Introduction [1]
- Pipeline (Selection / Reconstruction) [1-2]
- Data-MC Observablen + Rest (with quality cuts) [3-4]
- Impact of systematics (Snowstorm, for analysis -> more statistics needed) [3-4]
- New simulation (new ice model, iceprod, settings, latest software) [2]
- Summary (estimates for storage request) [1]
